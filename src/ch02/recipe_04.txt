# Subsection: There's more...

It helps to have bullets because:
-  They can help clarify
-  They can help organize

..  important::

    Do not flip the bozo bit.


# Subsection: There's more...
# Topic: Using directives

.. note:: Note Title

    We need to indent the content of an admonition.

    This will set the text off from other material.

.. parsed-literal::

    any text

    *almost* any format

    the text is preserved

    but **inline** markup can be used.
