  export PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8

  python

>>> with open('data/some_file.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as output:
...     print('You drew \U0001F000', file=output)
>>> with open('data/some_file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as input:
...     text = input.read()
>>> text
'You drew ðŸ€€\n'

>>> string_bytes = 'You drew \U0001F000'.encode('utf-8')
>>> string_bytes
b'You drew \xf0\x9f\x80\x80'


# Subsection: How it works...

>>> 'You drew \U0001F000'.encode('ascii')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\U0001f000' in position 9: ordinal not in range(128)
